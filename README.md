Hello, my name is Jose Gonzalez, I have always loved playing video games since I was a kid and while I played, I couldn't help and wonder what was going on the background of those games. Thatâ€™s when I decided I wanted to further educate myself, so I went to my local community college to study software. There, I received my Associates degree in Information Technology Programming. 
Coding games is my favorite hobby, I learn something new every-day.
The main reason I use GitHub is to show my work to the public. I have so many ideas for future projects that I want to pursue. I think learning to code is important because it opens up a lot of doors to the brain. Being able to create anything from scratch using a keyboard and mouse is something to be fascinated about.
